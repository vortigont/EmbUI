* update purecss to 3.0.0



### v3.1.0 - 2023.11.28
+ introduce UI objects storage on front-end
  This feature allows to pre-compile UI objects and store it in json file on file system.
  Front-end will fetch this data and keep the objects, while back-end could send a specific section with a request
  to get UI objects from the local storage on the front-end side.
  This will allow to save codespace on the backend for generating UI objects structure and just
  simply update retrieved objects with value data.

+ implement 'merge' strategy for uidata_xload sections (not fully tested yet)

* minor fixes and improvements in TimeProcessor
 - TimeProcessor::setTime() method accept value string with or withour seconds

+ render unknown non-main sections appending it to 'main'
    'interface' frame could contain 1st level sections without 'mian' flag,
    those sections were considered as a replacement content for the existing sections with same ID in DOM,
    so, if any non-main sections were found without any existing matching ID, those sections were silently dropped.
    From now on such sections are appended to 'main' and rendered below existing conted on the main page block

+ implement js api / uidata versioning checking
 - if version number  supplied in manifest/uidata_xload frames is newer then defined in js/json resource files,
   then notification message will be displayed at the top of main page letting user know that resource FS files are outdated

* bump jsapi to ver 3



### v3.0.0 - 2023.11.15
+ implement getters for Interface class
  - Interface::json_section_begin() methods now returns an JsonArrayConst object that points to the newly created section
    it could be used to inspect existing objects or serialize part of the Interface object
  - Interface::get_last_section() method return a const pointer to the last section in a stack
  - JsonObject Interface::get_last_object() method return and object of a recently created html element
    this method could be used to add/extend html object with arbitrary key:value objects that are not present in existing html element creation methods


* Interface::value(const ID id, const T val, bool html) will make a simple key:value pairs if 'html' is false
  -  i.e. if html parameter is false, an added items will be constructed {"device_pwrswitch":false},
    otherwise old behavior is used {"id":"device_pwrswitch", "value":false, "html": true}

* add constness to actionCallback_t parameter
  -  from now it's 'const JsonObject *data' to ensure that action data object can't not be changed inside action callbacks

+ implement section_xload()
    this function recoursevily looks through sections and picks ones with name 'xload'
    for such sections all html elements with 'url' object key will be side-load with object content into
    and object named 'block'. Same way as for xload() function.

* Interface - all member functions accept only 'const char*' as id parameter
  -  since js lib uses stringified id, it makes no sence for any other templaed types

+ add action id matching with wildcard prefix "*_some_id"
  -  works same way as wildcard suffix

+ FrameSendAsyncJS http API handler
  -  feeder is hooked to /api URI and processes API requests via HTTP
  -  only 'value' frame replies are supported due to inability to pipe multiple json onjects via single http request

+ implement FrameSendMQTT class for EmbUI feeders
  -  a transport class to send Interface object data to MQTT server
  -  default configuration is:
    - "value" packets are sent to ~/jpub/value topic
    - "interface", "xload", "section" packets are sent to ~/jpub/interface topic

    all other packets are sent to "jpub/etc" (could be removed in future)

+   unbind class Interface out of EmbUI class, implement FrameSend chain
  -  Interface is no longer uses EmbUI pointer, removed all deps on config-related vars
  -  EmbUI instance now has FrameSendChain feeders member, where various downstream transports could be regitered and used by Interface instances


+   replace weak functions with funtional callbacks
  -  implement user definable callbacks for the following weak functions
  -  section_main_frame()
  -  pubCallback()
  -  create_parameters()
  -  replaced with callbacks via ActionHandler class

+ FrameSend class refactoring
  - implement FrameSend chain list
  -  FrameSend abstract class has a member availabe() that allows to find if downstream is ready to send data
  -  FrameSendChain is a chained list of FrameSend objects that could send data over mutiple downstreams.
  -  Could be used as a common EmbUI data feeder with attachable plugins.
  - FrameSend::send() accepts generic type JsonVariantConst instead of only JsonObject

+ mDNS setup callback
  -  it is required to run mDNS service registration in proper order, so hooking to WiFi events does not work on system startup

**Major MQTT reimplementation**
mqttClient member is made public, User could use a flexibility to access it and set it's own hooks and features
     - make configuration have a flag to enable/disable mqtt clietn
     - rework a connector task that configures and connects the client
     - removed some ugly hangle() from a loop()
     - removed useless bool flags
     - removed tons of useless overloads
     - make default topic based on efuse MAC
     - user defined callbacks are completely removed
     - mqttClient is created on demand from now on, only of enabled and configured properly
     - EmbUI::publish() has templated overload to accept String contructable types for payload
     - _mqtt_pub_sys_status() pulishes life system params to mqtt in scope of send_pub() call
     - _onMqttConnect() will publish system data to ~/sys/ topic

    BasicUI - update MQTT setup form
    - add field to show current MQTT topicprefix
    - add comment for topic setup and $id macro


*   EmbUI::var* methods refactoring
     - methods use const char* as key params, removed String& overload
     - using string type traits for value evaluation and discarding null/zero valued keys

+ publish psram, rssi, uptime info in a more readable way
* basicui: fix save button on ftp page
* fix: when config variable was set false oom message was generated
* replace 'directly' with 'onChange', update ui templated methods

#### EmbUI:
  * saving/accessing config params as JsonVariant instead of cast to String's
  * do not save/overwrite config.json on param set if it's value has not changed
  + cfg param read/save/update tend to Null object design pattern
    + var_remove() method - allows removing existing keys from cfg
    + var_dropnulls() method - create/update cfg key only with non-null value, remove empty ones
    + removed almost all default values from EmbUI cfg
      + default autogenerated hostname is non-persistent and does not need to be saved in config file
      + default WiFi-related params is not saved in cfg file, no need to recreate it each time
      + default time/date options are no longer stored in cfg

  - user-js function to apply/copy current datetime from the browser via button's press

#### HTML elemetns:
  * default values from config used as JsonVariant (keeping it's type on save/load) instead of String'ifying
  + Button has types now - 'simple' button, 'submit' and 'js'
    + button can pass specified value on press along with it's element id
